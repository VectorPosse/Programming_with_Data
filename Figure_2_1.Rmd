In Markdown, text can be formatted with *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, ~~strikethrough~~, and `monospaced` text for code.

There is support for LaTeX, either inline math, $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$, or displayed math:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\lvert \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \rangle = \hat{H} \lvert \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \rangle.$$

You can create block quotes:

> This is a block quote.

Or horizontal rules:

* pointed
* lists
  * with
  * indented
    * outline
