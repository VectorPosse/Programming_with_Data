R notebooks don't use cells like Jupyter notebooks. They are plain text files with **Markdown formatting**. They can either be viewed as such, or processed into PDF, HTML, or Word files.

R notebooks have code "chunks" that run code. The chunks below run R code (and that's the standard way to use an R notebook), but they can also run other languages (like Python).

```{r}
2+2
```
```{r}
goals <- c('Study data science.', 'Find some data.',
           'Run some algorithms.', 'Profit!')
for (i in seq_along(goals)) {
    cat("Goal #", i, ": ", goals[i], "\n", sep = "")
}
```
